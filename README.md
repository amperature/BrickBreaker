## Favorite Video Game OST(s)

In terms of listening outside of the game, one of my favorites has to be the [Sonic Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkD7ee0Qz64&list=PLvNp0Boas721Cm9CWT9eaSq_JxA3f_NAr) soundtrack composed by **Hideki Naganuma**. I love the use of breakbeats and it's a style I have been heavily inspired by for my own stuff, especially during my earlier teens.

Another one I would like to mention is [The New Tetris soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlkWOeZjtRc&list=PL8CEE2E9C04FBD0BE&index=9) by **Neil Voss**. I am a massive fan of Tetris and this soundtrack stands out a lot as some of it is essentially breakcore, which is kinda crazy to hear in a Tetris game. This genre has also massively impacted my own works as well.
